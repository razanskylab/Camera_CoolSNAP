# Camera_CoolSNAP EZ2

Hardware interfacing library to directly access CoolSNAP camera from MATLAB.

## Installation
Library requires image acquisition toolbox of MATLAB and the support package of 
the company which you can request from the 
[Photometrics website](https://www.photometrics.com/support/third-party-software).

Afterwards you need to register the dll in MATLAB. I am sure there is a command
line version for this but I simply did it through the app called "Image 
Acquisition Tool".
